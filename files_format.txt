Used to record player inputs for deterministic replay.

Structure:
- Line 1: Random Seed (long)
  * The seed used for srand() to ensure identical random events (riddles, ghosts) during replay.
- Line 2: Step Count (size_t)
  * Total number of recorded inputs.
- Subsequent Lines: [Iteration] [Key]
  * Iteration (size_t): The game loop cycle number when the key was pressed.
  * Key (char): The actual character pressed by the user.

2. Results File Format (*.result)
---------------------------------
Used to validate the replay integrity by comparing critical game events required by the assignment.

Structure:
- Line 1: Event Count (size_t)
- Subsequent Lines: [Iteration] [Event Code] [Extra Data]
  * Iteration (size_t): Game cycle when the event occurred.
  * Event Code (int): ID representing the type of event (see table below).
  * Extra Data (string): Additional info required for the specific event type (e.g., riddle details).

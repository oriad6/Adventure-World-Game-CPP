Fixes applied for Ex2 Feedback:

Current Output Grade Received: 88

Calculation Check:
- Base Score: 100
- Deductions: -12
- Bonus Given: +2

Correct Calculation: 100 - 12 + 2 = 90
Issue: It appears the bonus points (+2) were acknowledged but not added to the final sum (88 reflects only the deduction: 100 - 12).

1. Issue: RNG (Random Number Generator) Seeding
   Feedback: "RNG should be seeded once at beginning of program using srand() before calling rand (GameManager::triggerRiddle)"
   
   Fix Description:
   - Removed the call to `srand()` from `GameManager::triggerRiddle()` (which caused re-seeding every time a riddle was triggered).
   - Moved the `srand()` initialization to `GameManager::initialize()`.
   - Result: `srand()` is now guaranteed to be called exactly once at the start of the program, ensuring proper random distribution for riddles and game events.

2. Issue: Dark Room Visibility
   Feedback: "dark room areas also hide the player, making the game excessively more difficult"

   Fix Description:
   - Modified `Screen::isPixelVisble` to allow a small visibility radius (2 blocks) around the player even in dark areas without a torch.
   - Result: Players can now navigate dark rooms with basic visibility of their immediate surroundings, preventing the game from being unplayable without a torch.

3. Issue: Door Configuration (Keys & Switches)
   Feedback: "there's apparently no way to configure which keys/switches are assigned to each door in screen files"

   Fix Description:
   - Clarification: The feature was implemented in the previous version but might have been missed due to file positioning (was mentioned as well in the README text file).
   - Verification: Verified that `GameManager::loadDoorRequirements` correctly parses the configuration section at the bottom of each `.screen` file.
   - Format: Doors are configured by ID, requiring specific amounts of keys and active switches (e.g., "Door 5 requires 2 keys and 1 active switch").
   - Action: Ensured all provided screen files (adv-world_01/02/03.screen) include explicit "# DOOR CONFIGURATION" sections at the bottom.

4. Issue: Door Destination vs. Door Configuration
   Feedback: "cannot change door destination via screen file (changing door number has no effect)"

   Clarification:
   - The number representing a door on the map (e.g., '5') is designed to be a "Lock Configuration ID", NOT a "Level Destination ID".
   - Changing the number effects which rules apply to open the door (keys/switches required), as defined in the "# DOOR CONFIGURATION" section.
   - The game progression is designed to be linear (Level 1 -> Level 2 -> Level 3) regardless of which specific door ID is used to exit the current room.
